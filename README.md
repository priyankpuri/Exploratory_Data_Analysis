# Exploratory_Data_Analysis

This is a project for the Exploratory Data Analysis Course offered by John Hopkins University.<br/>
There are four R codes which produce the same plot as their name.
<br/>

To run the scripts do the following things:
<ul>
<li>Download the data from here:<link> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;</link></li>
<li>Extract the data and copy the folder path</li>
<li>Download the code and change the path in the read.table and read.csv to read the files "household_power_consumption.txt" from the downloaded data</li>
</ul>
Some image sizes have been changed to give more clarity.If u want the same image size,just change the parameters in the png function.
